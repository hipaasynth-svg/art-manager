"""
Studio memory helpers: Cody's notes inbox + the self-improvement playbook.

Two plain files, so they're inspectable and editable by a human:

* ``STUDIO_NOTES.md`` — Cody writes here to "talk to" the agent between runs.
  The agent reads it every run and honors it. (You edit it on the main branch.)
* ``PLAYBOOK.md`` — what the agent has learned about what works. The agent
  appends to it each run (via ``reflect``) and reads it back next run, so it
  stops repeating what didn't work and doubles down on what did. Persisted with
  the rest of the studio memory between runs.

nooa-free and dependency-free, so it can be imported and unit-tested without the
agent runtime or an API key.
